                        Nelson Mandela , in full Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, byname Madiba, (born July 18, 1918, Mvezo,
                        South Africa—died
                        December 5, 2013, Johannesburg), black nationalist and the first black president of South Africa
                        (1994–99). His
                        negotiations in the early 1990s with South African Pres. F.W. de Klerk helped end the country’s
                        apartheid system of
                        racial segregation and ushered in a peaceful transition to majority rule. Mandela and de Klerk
                        were jointly awarded the
                        Nobel Prize for Peace in 1993 for their efforts.

                    <h2>Early Life And Work </h2>
                    Nelson Mandela was the son of Chief Henry Mandela of the Madiba clan of the Xhosa-speaking Tembu
                    people. After his
                    father’s death, young Nelson was raised by Jongintaba, the regent of the Tembu. Nelson renounced his
                    claim to the
                    chieftainship to become a lawyer. He attended South African Native College (later the University of
                    Fort Hare) and
                    studied law at the University of the Witwatersrand; he later passed the qualification exam to become
                    a lawyer. In 1944
                    he joined the African National Congress (ANC), a black-liberation group, and became a leader of its
                    Youth League. That
                    same year he met and married Evelyn Ntoko Mase. Mandela subsequently held other ANC leadership
                    positions, through which
                    he helped revitalize the organization and oppose the apartheid policies of the ruling National
                    Party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1952 in Johannesburg, with fellow ANC leader Oliver Tambo, Mandela established South Africa’s
                        first black law
                        practice, specializing in cases resulting from the post-1948 apartheid legislation. Also that
                        year, Mandela played an
                        important role in launching a campaign of defiance against South Africa’s pass laws, which
                        required nonwhites to carry
                        documents (known as passes, pass books, or reference books) authorizing their presence in areas
                        that the government
                        deemed “restricted” (i.e., generally reserved for the white population). He traveled throughout
                        the country as part of
                        the campaign, trying to build support for nonviolent means of protest against the discriminatory
                        laws. In 1955 he was
                        involved in drafting the Freedom Charter, a document calling for nonracial social democracy in
                        South Africa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mandela’s antiapartheid activism made him a frequent target of the authorities. Starting in
                        1952, he was intermittently
                        banned (severely restricted in travel, association, and speech). In December 1956 he was
                        arrested with more than 100
                        other people on charges of treason that were designed to harass antiapartheid activists. Mandela
                        went on trial that same
                        year and eventually was acquitted in 1961. During the extended court proceedings, he divorced
                        his first wife and married
                        Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela ( Winnie Madikizela-Mandela).

                    <h2>Underground Activity And The Rivonia Trial</h2>
                    After the massacre of unarmed black South Africans by police forces at Sharpeville in 1960 and the
                    subsequent banning of
                    the ANC, Mandela abandoned his nonviolent stance and began advocating acts of sabotage against the
                    South African regime.
                    He went underground (during which time he became known as the Black Pimpernel for his ability to
                    evade capture) and was
                    one of the founders of Umkhonto we Sizwe (“Spear of the Nation”), the military wing of the ANC. In
                    1962 he went to
                    Algeria for training in guerrilla warfare and sabotage, returning to South Africa later that year.
                    On August 5, shortly
                    after his return, Mandela was arrested at a road block in Natal; he was subsequently sentenced to
                    five years in prison.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In October 1963 the imprisoned Mandela and several other men were tried for sabotage, treason,
                        and violent conspiracy in
                        the infamous Rivonia Trial, named after a fashionable suburb of Johannesburg where raiding
                        police had discovered
                        quantities of arms and equipment at the headquarters of the underground Umkhonto we Sizwe.
                        Mandela’s speech from the
                        dock, in which he admitted the truth of some of the charges made against him, was a classic
                        defense of liberty and
                        defiance of tyranny. (His speech garnered international attention and acclaim and was published
                        later that year as I Am
                        Prepared to Die.) On June 12, 1964, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, narrowly escaping the
                        death penalty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Incarceration</h2>
                    From 1964 to 1982 Mandela was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town. He was
                    subsequently kept at the
                    maximum-security Pollsmoor Prison until 1988, when, after being treated for tuberculosis, he was
                    transferred to Victor
                    Verster Prison near Paarl. The South African government periodically made conditional offers of
                    freedom to Mandela, most
                    notably in 1976, on the condition that he recognize the newly independent—and highly
                    controversial—status of the
                    Transkei Bantustan and agree to reside there. An offer made in 1985 required that he renounce the
                    use of violence.
                    Mandela refused both offers, the second on the premise that only free men were able to engage in
                    such negotiations and,
                    as a prisoner, he was not a free man.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout his incarceration, Mandela retained wide support among South Africa’s black
                        population, and his imprisonment
                        became a cause célèbre among the international community that condemned apartheid. As South
                        Africa’s political situation
                        deteriorated after 1983, and particularly after 1988, he was engaged by ministers of Pres. P.W.
                        Botha’s government in
                        exploratory negotiations; he met with Botha’s successor, de Klerk, in December 1989.

                    </p>


                    <p>
                        On February 11, 1990, the South African government under President de Klerk released Mandela
                        from prison. Shortly after
                        his release, Mandela was chosen deputy president of the ANC; he became president of the party in
                        July 1991. Mandela led
                        the ANC in negotiations with de Klerk to end apartheid and bring about a peaceful transition to
                        nonracial democracy in
                        South Africa.

                    <p>
                    <h2>Presidency And Retirement</h2>
                    In April 1994 the Mandela-led ANC won South Africa’s first elections by universal suffrage, and on
                    May 10 Mandela was
                    sworn in as president of the country’s first multiethnic government. He established in 1995 the
                    Truth and Reconciliation
                    Commission (TRC), which investigated human rights violations under apartheid, and he introduced
                    housing, education, and
                    economic development initiatives designed to improve the living standards of the country’s black
                    population. In 1996 he
                    oversaw the enactment of a new democratic constitution. Mandela resigned his post with the ANC in
                    December 1997,
                    transferring leadership of the party to his designated successor, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela and
                    Madikizela-Mandela had
                    divorced in 1996, and in 1998 Mandela married Graca Machel, the widow of Samora Machel, the former
                    Mozambican president
                    and leader of Frelimo.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mandela did not seek a second term as South African president and was succeeded by Mbeki in
                        1999. After leaving office
                        Mandela retired from active politics but maintained a strong international presence as an
                        advocate of peace,
                        reconciliation, and social justice, often through the work of the Nelson Mandela Foundation,
                        established in 1999. He was
                        a founding member of the Elders, a group of international leaders established in 2007 for the
                        promotion of conflict
                        resolution and problem solving throughout the world. In 2008 Mandela was feted with several
                        celebrations in South
                        Africa, Great Britain, and other countries in honour of his 90th birthday.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mandela Day, observed on Mandela’s birthday, was created to honour his legacy by promoting
                        community service around the
                        world. It was first observed on July 18, 2009, and was sponsored primarily by the Nelson Mandela
                        Foundation and the
                        46664 initiative (the foundation’s HIV/AIDS global awareness and prevention campaign); later
                        that year the United
                        Nations declared that the day would be observed annually as Nelson Mandela International Day.

                    <p>
                        Mandela’s writings and speeches were collected in I Am Prepared to Die (1964; rev. ed. 1986), No
                        Easy Walk to Freedom
                        (1965; updated ed. 2002), The Struggle Is My Life (1978; rev. ed. 1990), and In His Own Words
                        (2003). The autobiography
                        Long Walk to Freedom, which chronicles his early life and years in prison, was published in
                        1994. An unfinished draft of
                        his second volume of memoirs was completed by Mandla Langa and released posthumously as Dare Not
                        Linger: The
                        Presidential Years (2017).
